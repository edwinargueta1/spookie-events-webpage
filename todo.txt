Following Specs for the Assigenment:


● The <time> tag for the blog date should be enclosed within its own span which can be individually
styled.






● The images should float on the right side of a blog entry next to the surrounding text. They must
stay within the bounds of the enclosing box, and not bleed into other content.

● The white containing box should have a solid, black, 4-px thick border.

● The blog boxes should have have a solid, black, 2-px thick border.

● The title box should have a solid, black, 1-px thick border.

● The friends box should have a <h1> for “Friends” and a <ul> with hyperlink list items to each friend.
The hyperlinks should be underlined and change color to red when moused-over (using the hover
pseudoclass).

● The friends box is a left-aligned independent div. The friends box should have a solid, black, 4-px
thick border.

● Set all padding/margins to best match the example above.

● Use the universal selector (*) so that if you hover over ANY element, it is highlighted yellow.
(This is a bit trickier than it may seem…you will need to EXCLUDE certain elements from this
behavior, like the html and body tag for instance.)
○ BE SURE TO USE THE UNIVERSAL SELECTOR! OTHER METHODS WILL LOSE CREDIT.
○ Additionally, in your code, create a comment section which will easily allow me to toggle
the background div’s highlight via commenting to test your code (I should only have to
comment toggle one section of code).
